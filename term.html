    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
      <h3>c. Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>Ssebowa ai virtual friend may connect you to third-party links and services that are not owned or controlled by us. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<div class="clause">
    <h2>Clause 4 - Content</h2>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>a. Your Content</h3>
        <p>By providing input to Ssebowa ai virtual friend services, users gain access to an output generated and returned based on their input ("Content"). All input belongs to the user, while Ssebowa ai virtual friend assigns all its rights, title, and interest in the output to the user. This grants users the freedom to use content for any purpose, including commercial endeavors, as long as they comply with these terms. Ssebowa ai virtual friend reserves the right to use content to provide and maintain the services in addition to complying with applicable laws and enforcing policies. Ultimately, it is the users' responsibility to ensure their content does not violate any laws or terms.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>b. Similarity of Content</h3>
        <p>Due to the advanced capabilities of machine learning, systems such as Ssebowa ai virtual friend or other third-party services will likely yield the same or comparable results when presented with the same input. For example, supposing someone were to ask a system "What color is the sun?" they would most likely receive a response of "The sun is yellow." Similarly, other users who posed the same query would presumably be given the same answer. It is important to note that users who submit identical or similar requests cannot claim ownership of the generated response as they are not considered the creators of the content.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>c. Use of Content to Improve Services</h3>
        <p>We do not make use of the content provided to or received from our API, otherwise known as "API content". To provide top-notch services, we may use non-API content from other sources like you to develop and improve our services. This allows us to take advantage of feedback from a wider user base as well as explore data from various sources to develop and improve our services. This use of external content helps us ensure that our services remain up-to-date and continue to offer our users the best possible user experience. If you would prefer that your non-API content not be used to improve our services, you can decide not to allow us. Please note that refusing us to use your non-API content may restrict our ability to offer an ideal solution tailored to your specific needs.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Clause 5 - Accuracy</h2>
    <p>The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning is advancing rapidly. We are continually striving to perfect our services to ensure they are accurate, reliable, and beneficial for end-users. As machine learning is based on probabilistic methods, there will be occasions where the results generated will not be completely accurate or correctly reflect real-world scenarios. Consequently, you must take care to carefully evaluate the accuracy of output for any use case before implementation, which may include manually reviewing the output too.</p>
    
    <h2>Clause 6 - Fees and Payments</h2>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>a. Fees and Billing</h3>
        <p>Payment of fees and billing are subject to the prices and conditions indicated on applicable pricing pages or as specified in writing between us. We reserve the right to amend any pricing errors or misapprehensions even if payments or invoices have already been issued. You must provide accurate billing information, including a viable and empowered payment method. We will post charges to the payment method at agreed intervals but may modify the date of posting at our discretion. You grant Ssebowa ai virtual friend and its associate companies plus any third-party payment processors permission to debit your payment method for fees. If your payment cannot be accomplished, we will issue you a notification in writing and may limit access to the services until repayment is completed. Bills in US dollars are payable upon invoice issuance, and payments are irrevocable except as explicitly stated in this Agreement.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>b. Taxes</h3>
        <p>Unless mentioned, charges may not incorporate federal, state, regional, and foreign levies, duties, and other similar charges ("taxes"). You are liable for all taxes attached to their purchase, except taxes based on our net income, and we could issue an invoice for such taxes. Users commit to paying taxes promptly and supplying us with evidence of payment or additional proof that may be sensibly required. For tax purposes, Ssebowa ai virtual friend utilizes the address and name in the customer's account registration as the location of supply, thus it is essential to keep this info correct and up-to-date.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>c. Price Changes</h3>
        <p>Price alterations may arise from time to time. In such cases, we will issue notification of any amendments to fees applicable to your account via your account page as well as our website. These changes will take effect after 21 days except in the case of legal or beta service (as stated in the Service Terms) adjustments, which will immediately become enforceable. Any alterations to prices will be implemented with immediate effect on your account fee following the activation of these changes.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>d. Disputes and Late Payments</h3>
        <p>If you have issues with or questions about fees or taxes, it is important to contact our team at info@ssebowa.org within thirty (30) days after the disputed invoice was sent. Unpaid invoices that are not in dispute may incur a 2% finance charge on their unpaid balance every month. If we detect that an amount of your fees has gone overdue, we reserve the right to suspend access to our services after providing written notice.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>e. Free Tier</h3>
        <p>The generous free tier of our services is to be enjoyed responsibly. We kindly ask that users do not attempt to circumvent this by creating multiple accounts to benefit from the credits provided in the free tier. We reserve the right to take action if we suspect that users have acted against this in bad faith, for example by charging them standard fees or suspending access to the services.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="clause">
    <h2>Clause 7 - Confidentiality, Security, and Data Protection</h2>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>a. Confidentiality</h3>

    </div>
</div>

<div class="clause">
    <h2>Clause 8 - Term and Termination</h2>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>a. Termination; Suspension</h3>
        <p>The Terms of Use of using the services and content take effect when you initially begin using them and remain in effect until terminated. You have the option to terminate these terms at any point for any reason by discontinuing your use of the services and content. We possess the right to terminate these terms for any reason at any time with notice given to you at least 30 days prior. We can also opt to immediately terminate these terms if there is a breach in usage requirements, confidentiality, security and data protection, dispute resolution, or general terms. Additionally, we may terminate the terms to comply with a law or government request or due to changes in relationships with third parties outside of our control. It is also possible for us to suspend your access to the services if there is a security risk posed to us or another party or if we suspect fraudulent activity or if using the services could subject us or another party to liability.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>b. Effect on Termination</h3>
        <p>If your access to the Ssebowa ai virtual friend is terminated, you understand and agree that you may no longer have access to Ssebowa services.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="clause">
    <h2>Clause 9 - Dispute Resolution</h2>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>a. Mandatory Arbitration</h3>
        <p>Mandatory arbitration has been established as a means of resolving disputes between Ssebowa ai virtual friend and its users relating to these terms or services. Both parties agree that any past or present claims that arise out of the usage of Ssebowa ai virtual friend's services will be resolved through final and binding arbitration, except for certain rights of the user to opt out should they wish to do so. If a user wishes to opt out of the arbitration terms or any future changes to them, they must fill out the relevant form within 30 days of agreeing to the arbitration terms. This then will allow a user to choose another mode of dispute resolution, such as litigation or mediation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>b. Informal Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>Before taking any formal legal action against Ssebowa ai, we would like to help you address your concerns. You are encouraged to reach out to us at info@ssebowa.org with your name, a full description of the issue, and the outcome you desire. We will strive to find a solution to the conflict within 60 days. Any applicable statute of limitations for bringing a lawsuit will be extended for the duration of the 60-day resolution period.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>c. Arbitration Forum</h3>
        <p>Arbitration is an effective method of resolving conflicts without resorting to litigation. Both parties may opt to initiate arbitration through a third-party arbitration provider such as ADR Services. The two individuals involved in the dispute shall each pay half of the total cost of conducting the arbitration. However, should it be determined that one of the parties is unable to afford the cost of arbitration or obtain a waiver, Ssebowa ai virtual friend may step in and pay the fees on your behalf. It is also important to note that Ssebowa ai virtual friend will not attempt to collect attorneys' charges or expenses unless the arbitrator determines the claim to be frivolous.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>d. Arbitration Procedures</h3>
        <p>Arbitration procedures will take into account a variety of methods. These may include telephone conversations, written submissions, video conferencing, or face-to-face meetings held in Cheyenne, Wyoming, or at any other mutually agreed-upon location. All disputes will be resolved by an individual arbitrator provided by ADR Services, operating under prevailing rules. The only exception would be for a Wyoming court to determine the enforceability, scope, and arbitrability of this particular agreement along with the mass filing procedures outlined in the clauses. Additionally, the amount of any settlement offer will remain confidential between the parties until after the arbitrator renders their final decision.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>e. Exceptions</h3>
        <p>This article outlines what claims are not subject to arbitration as outlined in the arbitration section. Specifically, individual claims brought to small claims court and injunctive or other equitable relief required to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the services or infringement of intellectual property are exempt from arbitration. Consequently, litigants have the option to pursue these exceptions in small claims court or to seek equitable relief outside of arbitration.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>f. No Class Actions</h3>
        <p>These Terms of Use do not create any agency, partnership, or joint venture between you and Ssebowa. You agree that you will not take any action at law or in equity for any claim arising out of these Terms of Use, the use of our ai virtual friend, or our services. You hereby waive any right to file or participate in any class action lawsuit against Ssebowa related to our ai virtual friend or the Terms of Use. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed from these Terms of Use, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>g. Mass Filings</h3>
        <p>If a large number of identical claims are brought forward against Ssebowa ai virtual friend or connected entities (known as a mass filing), ADR Services will allocate consecutive numbers to each of these filings. The first ten submissions (also known as 'Initial Test Cases') shall be afforded precedence and proceed to arbitration. Within 120 days after the inaugural pre-hearing conference, the arbitrators will deliver a conclusive ruling barring a prior resolution or if both sides agree to extend the timeline. This will be followed by a 90-day Mediation Period during which the outstanding cases should be mediated based on the judgments from the aforementioned Initial Test Cases. If a conclusion cannot be achieved during this interval, parties are at liberty to opt out of the arbitration process and instead pursue court proceedings. Written notice of this decision must be submitted within 60 days of the end of the Mediation Period. In any other eventuality, the remaining cases will move forward as per their assigned order. The statute of limitations applicable in each instance will be put on hold until the date on which the Initial Test Cases are decided.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sub-clause">
        <h3>h. Severability</h3>
        <p>If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable according to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding the Ssebowa ai virtual friend and supersede any prior agreements. You may also be subject to additional Terms of Use that may apply when you use certain services, third-party content, or third-party software. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision in that or any other instance. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
